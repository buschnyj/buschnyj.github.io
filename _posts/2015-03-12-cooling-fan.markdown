I wanted to re-create a real-life object into CAD for practice. Actual measurement, design, and rendering took two afternoons to do.

I used a caliper, Autodesk Fusion 360, and a camera for the entire project.

What went well:

- All measurements were accurate.
- Rendering took approximately 12 minutes.
